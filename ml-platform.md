# Selecting a platform for Machine Learning

We are going to be learning ML by practice.  So we need to learn a platform that we can use. I look for the following attributes on a ML platform
- Easy to learn : this is paramount.. We need to be able to learn this quickly and improve as we go along.
- Modern
- Easy to setup and use
- Has an easy to use UI (IDE or UI)
- Has a good thriving ecosystem (good community around it.  good amount of content on Stackoverflow ..etc)
- Has good proven ML libraries

Here are a few good choices
* Python
    - Easy to learn and use
    - ML libraries : Numpy, Pandas, Scikit
* Java
    - Enterprisy
    - ML Libraries : Weka, Mahout
* R
    - Very capable
    - ML Libraries : many many
* Spark
    - Provides a scale
    - ML Libraries : Spark ML

## First Choice : Python
You can't go wrong with any of the above.  

**My suggestion is you learn PYTHON.**

Here is why

- In the early days, Python was considered a ‘toy language for ML’ and all serious work was done in R.  But Python has come a long way in the last few years as a very solid ML / DL language.
- It has a very thriving ecosystem of libraries in both ML and DL.  Lot of popular packages like Tensorflow have python APIs.
- It is a very easy language to pick up.  Most programmers (Java / C / PHP) can pick up Python very easily in a couple of days.. And can keep learning as they go along.   To me this very important as we don’t want to spend too much time learning the language
- Python is  general purpose language.  If you learn Python, and you are not practicing ML, you can pretty much write any other system — web service, generic scripting ..etc using Python.
- On the other hand R – as good as it is for ML work – is very specific for analytics.  It is not a general purpose language.
- Python has very easy to use UIs.  My favorite is Jupyter notebooks. They are web based, light weight and easy to use
- There are lots of FREE and open source resources to learn Python

## Second Pick: Spark
Once you are comfortable in Python, I'd recommend also learning Spark.  Here is why:
- When you have more data that can be handled by a single computer, we need to use cluster computing to crunch all that data
- Spark is a popular distributed computing framework.  It allows us to process large amount of data
- Spark has a built in Machine Learning library that you can utilize out of the box
- And the best news is Spark has Python API (in addition to Scala, Java and R)

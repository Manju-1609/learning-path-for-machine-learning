# Basic Statistics
It is good to refresh some stats for ML.

## Prerequisites
In order to do these exercises, you need to learn the stats functions in your ML platform (Python, Java, R ..etc.).  
For Python it is Numpy.  
Refer to our [Numpy](learn-python.md#numpy) section to learn the basics of Numpy.

## Part 1 - Recommended

### 1.1 -  Resources

#### Generic
- **Online lecture notes : A nice series by [Ellen Venable](http://www.cabrillo.edu/~evenable/) from [Cabrillo College](http://www.cabrillo.edu/).**  
Has very engaging graphics and very easy to read and understand.  Each chapter has good set of exercises too.
    - [CH 01 - Basic Intro](http://www.cabrillo.edu/~evenable/ch01.pdf) - Introduces concepts like population vs. sample and variable types
    - [CH 02 - Organizing and Graphing Data](http://www.cabrillo.edu/~evenable/ch02.pdf) - Introduces basic graph types, frequency distribution.
    - [CH 03 - Inspecting numerical data](http://www.cabrillo.edu/~evenable/ch03.pdf) - Talks about numeric data analysis : mean, median, range, variance, standard deviation ..etc
- Book : **'Practical Statistics for Data Scientists' by Andrew Bruce, Peter Bruce** ([Safari link](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/practical-statistics-for/9781491952955/),  [Amazon Link](https://www.amazon.com/_/dp/1491952962?tag=oreilly20-20))  
This is a fantastic book that provides concise, easy to understand explanation of essential statistics needed for Machine Learning.

#### Covariance / Correlation
* Covariance :  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGbpuFNR1ME  (excellent video by Bradon Foltz)
* Correlation : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EXNedimDMs  (excellent video by Bradon Foltz)
* Covariance Matrix : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=locZabK4Als  (excellent video by Bradon Foltz)


### 1.2 - Check List
You should be familiar with the following
- Population vs. sample
- Variable types (quantitative, discrete, continuous)
- Plot basic graphs
- Do numerical analysis such as mean, median, variance, standard deviation
- Correlation

### 1.3 - Quick Exercise
This is a simple exercise designed to reinforce your learning so far.

We have some sample salary data (in thousands) from two cities.  
```
city1 = [15,12, 20, 25, 50, 35, 75, 80, 60, 45, 36]
city2 = [40,42, 45, 60, 55, 52, 56, 52, 62, 57, 48]
```

Calculate mean, median, variation, standard deviation for both city data.
